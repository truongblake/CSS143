/* Class Shape
 *
 * By Rob Nash (with minor edits by David Nixon)
 * 
 * This is the superclass in a hierarchy of shapes that you have to construct
 */

// the superclass in our inheritance hierarchy
// all "common" features, functions and data should go here
// for example, all shapes in Java2D have a x,y that declares their position
// and many of the shapes exposed have a width and a height (but not all, so we didn't put width and height here)
// Note that this class is mostly empty, as there is no algorithm generic enough to guess an arbitrary shape's area 
// (future subclasses must override getArea() to provide something reasonable)
// Also, the draw method is empty too, as we don't know what shape to draw here! 
// (again, our subclasses will need to replace this method with one that actually draws things)
