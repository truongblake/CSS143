/**
 * VideoGame1
 * ----------
 * This class instantiates a small graphics-based video game where you move around one little shape
 * (using the arrow keys) and try to crash into some other little shapes. 
 * The VideoGame1 class extends the JFrame class, which is a class built into Java's Swing package of graphics classes.
 * The JFrame is essentially a window that opens on your computer screen and which you can add things into.
 * The VideoGame1 class also implements the KeyListener and ActionListener interfaces.
 * (Although we are not currently using the ActionListener interface for anything, so the ActionPerformed method is left blank)
 * The KeyListener interface requires that I have 3 methods:
 * keyPressed(), keyTyped(), and keyReleased() -- Though I only use the first of these; the others are left blank.
 * Implementing the KeyListener interface makes it easier to add a keyListener (which is this class itself),
 * which will listen for keyboard keys being pressed and when a key is pressed, the keyPressed() method will be called,
 * and this can be used to update the location of the shape that is being moved around.
 * The game keeps track of your score. When you have got all three shapes that you're supposed to chase, you win.
 * 
 * You use the arrow keys to move around. Type 'Q' to quit.
